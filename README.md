Jsign is a Java implementation of Microsoft Authenticode that lets you sign
and timestamp executable files for Windows, Microsoft Installers (MSI), Cabinet
files (CAB), Catalog files (CAT) and scripts. Jsign is platform independent and
provides an alternative to native tools like signcode/signtool on Windows or the
Mono development tools on Unix systems.

Jsign comes as an easy-to-use task/plugin for the main build systems (Maven,
Gradle, Ant). It's especially suitable for signing executable wrappers and
installers generated by tools like NSIS, msitools, install4j, exe4j or launch4j.
Jsign can also be used programmatically or standalone as a command line tool.

## Features
* Platform independent signing of Windows executables, DLLs, Microsoft Installers (MSI), Cabinet files (CAB), Catalog files (CAT) and scripts (PowerShell, VBScript, JScript, WSF)
* Timestamping with retries and fallback on alternative servers (RFC 3161 and Authenticode protocols supported)
* Supports multiple signatures per file, for all file types
* Extracts and embeds detached signatures to support [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/embedded-signatures/)
* Hashing algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512
* Keystores supported:
  * PKCS#12, JKS and JCEKS files
  * PKCS#11 hardware tokens ([YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com), [Nitrokey](https://www.nitrokey.com), etc)
  * Cloud key management systems ([AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/), [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/), [DigiCert ONE](https://one.digicert.com), [Google Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management), [SSL.com eSigner](https://www.ssl.com/esigner/))
* Private key formats: PVK and PEM (PKCS#1 and PKCS#8), encrypted or not
* Certificates: PKCS#7 in PEM and DER format
* Build tools integration (Maven, Gradle, Ant)
* Command line signing tool
* Authenticode signing API ([Javadoc](https://ebourg.github.io/jsign/apidocs/))
